# TradeBot
Welcome to the TradeBot Repository!

## Privacy policy
If you have access to this repository, please do not give access to anyone else without unanimous consent from all contributors.
The reason being that we have no idea where this is going, but it's best to keep it contained at least until we have something working.

## Credits
This project would not be possible without [danpaquin](https://github.com/danpaquin/gdax-python "danpaquin") laying the groundwork.

## Where We're going
This repository will hopefully become a collection of bots that can be pit against each other. We're hoping to collect organized data about how our bots are doing at all times and use that data to improve performance.
