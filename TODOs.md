# TODO

+ Project proposal (due Friday, Feb. 16)
+ Setup database and database/bot interface
+ Research what people have done with machine learning in algorithmic trading.
+ Get comfortable using Tkinter, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and matplotlib (see udemy courses)
    
## Things to thing about
Here are some things that need to be seriously considered before diving into the programming:

### Database and information handling    
+ How exactly are we going to store information?
+ What information will we store?
+ How can we easily and reliably access stored information?
+ Can we keep our database running on a remote server and pull information from it? What would this entail?

### Machine Learning
+ What information should be in our feature vectors?
+ How should we classify historical data?
+ How can we continually train our model as the bot runs without hindering bot responsiveness and trading?
+ What classifier should we use?
+ How can we allow our learning model adapt to changing market patterns?
+ How can we test our learning model reliably?
+ What information do we need to visualize? Should the user have any role in choosing feature vectors?
+ How should we handle missing data?

### GUI
+ How can we reliably, automatically update the graphs?
+ What should be the extent of the user's interaction with bot behavior?
+ Should we show the user visuals that have to do with machine learning and inner workings?
