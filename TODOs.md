# TODO

    + Project proposal (due Friday, Feb. 16)
    + Setup database and database/bot interface
    + Research what people have done with machine learning in algorithmic trading.
    + Get comfortable using Numpy, Scikit-learn, and matplotlib (see udemy courses)
    
## Things to thing about
    
    + How exactly are we going to store information?
    + What information will we store?
    + How can we easily and reliably access stored information?
    + Can we keep our database running on a remote server and pull information from it? What would this entail?
