Nic: paper. 
Sam: code.

1.	Make an account with GDAX and setup API keys

2.	Set up MongoDB server on Ubuntu and allow remote access

3.	continually retrieve data from GDAX and store it in the Mongo
		- storing price, time, and side of trade information
		
4.	download whatever data from server as a csv file for offline development.

5.	preprocess data
		- summarizing data by taking mean of price within a window (a few minutes)
		- removing time and formulating it as a supervised learning problem.
		
6.	Train an LSTM network. Play around with details of the network such as number of hidden 
	layers, hidden layer size, activation functions, etc. Find out what is best for our 
	problem.
	
7.	Add more features to the dataset such as number of buys and number of sells in the 
	specified window - maybe more complex data such as standard deviation of points within 
	the window.

8.	repeat step 6 and step 7

9.	Convert to online learning somehow - Our project for this class may include this, and 
	maybe not. We'll see how far I get in the next couple days.
	
10.	Make recommendation system given LSTM prediction (Should we buy or sell and how much?)

11. Make the freaking trades and a butt-ton of money.
